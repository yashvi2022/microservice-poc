# Polyglot Microservices Platform

This project is a **showcase system** demonstrating modern software
architecture with a **polyglot stack.**
- **.NET (C#)** → API Gateway & Authentication
- **Go** → Task Service (high-performance event-driven service)
- **Python** → Analytics Service (data processing, reporting)
- **Sveltekit** → Frontend

It is designed to highlight skills in **distributed systems,
microservices, DevOps, and clean code**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Quickstart

If you just quick want to see it all in action

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And then go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Demo

Below is a small gif showing startup and stack in action.

Recap: 
* Frontend is hosted on it's own port outside the API gateway.
* All API calls is hitting API gateway and is redirected to corresponding API (Task, Auth, Analytics).
* When a Project and Task is created, it's stored in Postgres and a event is sent to KAFKA.
* There is an Analytics worker server, that listens for new events on projects / tasks.
    * When an event is consumed it stores the event in it's own database and also updates project / task / user metrics.

## 🔹 Architecture

``` mermaid

    subgraph Client
        UI[Frontend - Sveltekit]
    end

    subgraph Gateway[API Gateway - .NET]
        AUTH[Auth Service - .NET]
        TASKS[Task Service - Go]
        ANALYTICS[Analytics Service - Python]
        AUTH -->|stores| PGA[(Postgres)]
        TASKS -->|stores| PGB[(Postgres)]
        TASKS -->|publishes| MQ[(Kafka)]
        MQ --> ANALYTICS
        ANALYTICS -->|stores| MDB[(MongoDB)]
    end

    UI --> Gateway

    Gateway --> AUTH
    Gateway --> TASKS
    Gateway --> ANALYTICS

```

## 🔹 Services

### API Gateway (.NET 9, YARP)

-   Routes requests to internal services
-   Handles JWT authentication & rate limiting

### Auth Service (.NET 9)

-   User registration & authentication
-   Issues JWT tokens
-   Stores user data in PostgreSQL

### Task Service (Go)

-   Manages projects and tasks (CRUD)
-   Publishes events (`task_created`, `task_updated`) to Kafka
-   Stores data in PostgreSQL

### Analytics Service (Python, FastAPI)

-   Computes analytics (task counts, completion times, etc.)
-   Exposes REST API for dashboards

### Analytics Worker (Python)

-   Consumes events from Kafka
-   Stores results in MongoDB

### Frontend (Sveltekit)

-   Small Webclient to call all API endpoints
-   Developer tool page, describing the solution and tools


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Infrastructure

-   **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
-   **Message Broker**: Kafka
-   **Containerization**: Docker

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 License

TODO

## 🔹 Roadmap

* License
* Cleanup
    * .http files
    * outdated tests
    * Documentation and copilot-instructions.md
* Better Domain Driven Design across codebase.

## 🔹 Ideas / Nice to have

* Authentication Events (UserRegisteredEvent, UserLoggedInEvent, etc.) (Using Postgres Kafka connector! :D)
* Opentelemetry across the stack
* Tests
* Fix known bugs. Eg. Complete a task and open it again doesn't update the metrics count, so you are able to get > 100% completed tasks :D Also Analytics page is broken until some data has been created
* Kafka Schema registry
* Contribution
